# DeployMLModelUsingStreamlit
This project demonstrates how to train multiple regression models and deploy them using a Streamlit web app. Users can select an ML algorithm from the sidebar, input data interactively through sliders, and view real-time predictions with model accuracy and optional feature importance.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Train 4 popular ML models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

âœ… Deploy using Streamlit with a clean and intuitive UI

âœ… Interactive sliders for feature input

âœ… Model selection via sidebar

âœ… Real-time prediction of California housing prices

âœ… RÂ² Score (accuracy) shown for selected model

âœ… Feature importance visualization (for tree-based models)

ðŸ§  Dataset Used
This app uses the California Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets, which includes real-world housing data such as:

Average number of rooms

Latitude, longitude

Median income

Population, and more...
